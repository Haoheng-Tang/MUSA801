1.  What is the use case? Why is this important?

Our tool targets the fire department and residents.

The Philadelphia Fire Department responds to hundreds or even thousands
of locations everyday to quell an array of emergencies. Currently, they
have no ‘situational awareness’ of fire risk for a given location when
an emergency call comes in. Therefore, we are going to help them create
such a tool, by providing a parcel-level (building) fire risk score
prediction for each property in the City;

In addition, we want to let residents get a real-time update of the fire
risk of their houses so they will have a situational awareness on risk
for each property citywide

2.  What are your exploratory analysis questions?

1 Are there correlations between building fires and features like
property age, property type, Code Violations, 311, neighborhood, whether
there are elders or infants?

2 how can the features influence the risk of nearby properties?

3 What factors should be set as default parameters for the API routines?
And what factors can be acquired dynamically by API?

3.  What are the team roles?

Huidi Hu - fire data/model

Zirui Chen, Haoheng Tang - API tasks
